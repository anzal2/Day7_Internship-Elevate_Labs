## 📝 Description

I performed a full manual audit of my installed browser extensions to identify and remove unused, suspicious, or potentially malicious ones. This helped me enhance browser security and performance.

## 🛠️ Steps I Followed

### 1. 🔎 Opened the Browser’s Extension Manager:
- **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
- **Firefox:** `about:addons`

### 2. 📋 Reviewed All Installed Extensions:
- Looked through each extension manually.
- Checked for unknown or outdated ones.

### 3. ⚠️ Checked Permissions & Online Reviews:
- Inspected permissions like:
  - Access to all websites
  - Viewing/modifying data
- Verified reviews on the Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons site.

### 4. ❌ Identified Unused or Suspicious Extensions:
- Shortlisted those that were:
  - No longer in use.
  - Poorly rated.
  - Asking for unnecessary access.

### 5. 🗑️ Removed the Risky or Unnecessary Ones:
- Deleted any extension I didn’t trust or need.
- Focused on improving both privacy and speed.

### 6. 🔄 Restarted the Browser:
- Relaunched the browser to apply changes.
- Observed slight improvements in speed.

### 7. 🧠 Researched the Risks of Malicious Extensions:
- Found out they can:
  - 🕵️‍♂️ Spy on browsing activity
  - 🧪 Inject malicious scripts
  - 🧬 Steal login credentials or cookies
  - 🔀 Redirect to phishing websites

### 8. 🧾 Documented Everything:
- Listed removed extensions.
- Logged my actions in this README for future reference.
- Will repeat this check every month or after installing new add-ons.
